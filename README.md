It is a pilot version (0.9) of the UCCA annotation of the book "The Little Prince" by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry in its classic translation by Arieh Lerner. The text is taken from the Ben Yehuda project (https://benyehuda.org/read/4041).
While the annotation was conducted according to version 2 of UCCA's foundational layer guidelines, since this is a pilot version, the version of the corpus is 0.9.
